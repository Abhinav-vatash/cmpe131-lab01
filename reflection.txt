 
 Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of software
engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it prevent?

Branches are a powerful and safe way for teams to collaborate as it lets developers work on the same project without interfering with each other's code.
Through Pull requests integrated with CI/CD pipelines, changes can be automatically tested, built, and deployed.
Branches are great at preventing developers accidentally overwriting each other's code which could affect the team's productivity
